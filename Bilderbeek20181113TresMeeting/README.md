# TECE meeting 2018-11-14

How to get merge conflicts:

 * Big commits
 * No coding standard
 * Big functions
 * Infrequent merging

Hypothesis: collaborations are rare, because

  1. No shared research experiment
  2. Don't know how to do it
  3. Unrealistic expectations

Examples:

 * Femke & Jolien
 * Jorik & Kees
 * Elles
 * Joris & Tom
 * djog_unos_2018/Nature Zen
 * razzo

Rules 'How to do it':

 * Automate feedback
 * Communicate with tests

 * Give team members the roles that come naturally
 * Always be there for the team
 * Enforce a coding standard
 * Use a master-develop-topic branching structure
 * Visualize progress

Rules 'Unrealistic expectations':

 * You will need to learn the tools
 * You will need to learn a collaborative workflow
 * You will need to learn a collaborative attitude
 * Assume it will take time for the team to get up to speed
 * Expect things go different
 * Expect you will get hurt
